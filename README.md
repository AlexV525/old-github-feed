# old-github-feed

Brings back GitHub's old feed. To use this, install a user script manager (like https://www.tampermonkey.net/), then go to https://github.com/Gerrit0/old-github-feed/raw/main/old-feed.user.js and it will prompt you to install.

If you can't install user scripts, you can use https://github.com/dashboard-feed to view the old feed (with slightly broken styling) manually.

## Features

1. Caches following feed to localStorage to improve page load speed
2. Automatically reloads the following feed every minute like GitHub did
3. Allows quickly switching between the Following/For you feeds, and remembers which one was last active
