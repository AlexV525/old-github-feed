# old-github-feed

Brings back GitHub's old feed. To use this, install a user script manager (like https://www.tampermonkey.net/), then go to https://github.com/Gerrit0/old-github-feed/raw/main/old-feed.user.js

If you can't install user scripts, you can use https://github.com/dashboard-feed to view the old feed (with slightly broken styling) manually.
